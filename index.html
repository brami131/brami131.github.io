        <p class="lead mb-4"> About Me: My name is Braulio Ramirez and I'm a History Major. I currently attend UCR, and as of now I'm in my 2nd year. I expect to graduate in the year 2028 with a bachelors in History and minor in education. See, I want to be a teacher/professor since I've always been fond of the past and had always intrigued me. Teaching History to others is my dream and I want my future students to leave my class with insightful knowledge/applicable knowledge, so they can see how important history is. I want them to see how the past and it's trajection impact all of us.<br><br>

        Hobbies: I like to partake in physical and mental activities. Whether it's reading a new book, learning a new language, cooking a new dish, or partaking in a sport, being active helps my overall quality of life. Physical and Mental Activies translate very well into other aspects of life, such as my work/academic life. For example, going to the gym daily instilled in me a disciple and motivation to do the best in everything I do, which has translated into my academic/work life. It also strenghthened my mentality/outlook in life, by giving me self control and temperance. My favorite hobby is boxing since the ring is a theatre of truth. You can't come in with your coaches, friends, or anyone but yourself. The ring reveals alot about a person's resilience, true character, and courage. That's why I love boxing because you can't fake it and that it's you vs you. I currently attend the UCR Boxing Highlander Club and plan on boxing in the USIBA card in November. Besides boxing, I love reading. To me, reading blooms wisdom and critical thinking, which is why I forve myself everyday at night to read 15 pages a day. The genre to me really doesn't matter but if I had to read one genre for the rest of my life it'd be non-fiction. Another hobby I take part in is cooking new dishes/making new drinks. I get my ideas from Lemon 8 and I will be honest I barely just started 3 months ago. Nevertheless, I've been able to cook Greece/Indian/Turkish Food. My favorite has to be the time I made the Mediterraenean Diet in one dish. It was really great, not that time consuming, and it was approved by my family. I can confidently say, just show me the ingredients and I will be able to cook it. I love cooking, and my favorite part is the eating part. Besides food, I've also made homemade Starbucks Drinks. The reason why I got into making homemade Starbucks drinks was because I was getting too addicted, often spending $40 per month on drinks. I had to put a stop, so, I did what any reasonable person would do and that is making the drinks at home. So far, I've made the Caramel frappe, Dragonfruit Lemonade, and Pumpkin Spice Drinks.<br><br>

        What I plan to do after college: I plan obtaining my Masters and then hopefully a PhD. This will make me more credible and appealing to employers.
